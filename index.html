      <h2>What this book actually gives you</h2>
      <p>
        Probabilistic Execution is built around the Grizzly Parrot Parthenon: a ten-pillar execution framework that
        covers preparation, timing, entries, management, and review. It’s not theory for theory’s sake. It’s a set of
        rules you can run every session.
      </p>
      <ul class="pe-list">
        <li>Clear daily preparation process so you stop opening the platform blind.</li>
        <li>Defined session timing, so you know when you trade and when you leave it alone.</li>
        <li>A+ setup criteria built from context, liquidity, structure, and confirmation.</li>
        <li>Risk rules that decide size, stops, and invalidation before you ever click.</li>
        <li>No-trade filters that keep you out of garbage conditions and emotional spirals.</li>
        <li>Post-session review framework so you actually learn instead of repeat mistakes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who it’s for</h2>
      <p>
        This isn’t written for people looking for the next indicator or a copy-and-paste signal service. It’s for traders
        who:
      </p>
      <ul class="pe-list">
        <li>Understand that execution, not “secret sauce,” is what keeps accounts alive.</li>
        <li>Want a repeatable way to qualify, execute, and manage trades.</li>
        <li>Are tired of trading different every day and calling it “adapting.”</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="pe-section">
      <h2>What you get right now</h2>
      <ul class="pe-list">

        <li>A separate download of the three-phase professional trading routine pulled from the book.</li>
        <li>A framework you can adapt to your own style instead of starting from scratch every session.</li>
      </ul>
